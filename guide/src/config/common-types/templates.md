# Templates

Templates are special strings that can be interpolated from a number of sources. Template interpolations
take the form of the syntax `${tag:content}`, where `tag` is a single character identifying the source
that data should be read from, and content describes what data should be read from the source.

Depending of the field in the config file, the resulting string may then be parsed into some other data
type (such as a Duration).

## Template Sources

The following available sources are:

- `"e"`: An environment variable, read in as a String.
  
  Example: `${e:PORT}`

- `"v"`: A variable value from the [vars section](../vars-section.md). For nested values, keys/indices are separated by `"."`.
  
  Example:

  Given the following `vars` section:
  ```yaml
  vars:
    a: true
    b:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
    c:
      e: "hello"
    d:
      f:
        - false
        - false
        - true
  ```
  Then the following templates can be used:

  - `${v:a}` will be `true`
  - `${v:b.0}` will be `1`
  - `${v:c}` will be `{ "e": "hello" }`
  - `${v:d.f}` will be `[false, false, true]`

- `"p"`: A value from a [provider](../providers-section.md) of the specified name.
  
  Example: `${p:foo}` will be a single json value read from a provider named `"foo"`

  Alternatively, the [declare subsection](../endpoints-section.md#declare-subsection) value of that name for the current endpoint.

- `"x"`: A JavaScript expression. Other templatings can be included within.

  Examples:

  - `${x:foo()}` will call the `foo()` helper function
  - `${x:foo(${v:foo_var}, ${p:bar_prov})}` will pass the js value stored in `vars: foo_var`, as well
    as a value from the `bar_prov` provider.
  - `${x:encode(${e:PORT})}` will pass the `PORT` environment variable into the `encode()` function.

## Template Types

Which sources are available for a given field of the config is determined by the type of the
template. All template types can use expressions (`${x:_}`), but the others are limited. The
types of templates are:

- E-Templates: Only values from the Environment Variables can be read from.
- V-Templates: Only values from the [vars section](../vars-section.md) can be read from.
- R-Templates (Regular Templates): [Providers](../providers-section.md) or
  [vars](../vars-section.md) values can be read from.

## Examples

- `"${e:HOME}/file.txt"`: A valid E-Template.
- `"https://localhost:${v:port}/index.html?user=${p:users}"`: A valid R-Template.

## Notes

- `v` and `p` sources will be rendered as Strings when interpolated at the top level. Inside of
  `x` sources, they will be treated as the actual json value.

  Example:

  With the given `vars` section:

  ```
  vars:
    a: true
    b:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
  ```

  Then the V-Template `"${v:a}r"` will be the literal string `"truer"`, and the V-Template
  `"${x:${v:b}[2] * 100}"` will read `${v:b}` as the literal array `[1, 2, 3]`, of which the
  index `2` value (`3`) is read and multiplied by `100`, making the whole template evaluate
  to the string `"300"`.

- E-Templates exclusively appear in the `vars` section. R-Templates are used for building the
  requests, and primarily appear in the [endpoints section](../endpoints-section.md).
